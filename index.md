### [Turn Marker](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/turnmarker/)
Marks whose turn it is by outlining the token in a custom border that you can choose. 

### [Combat Enhancements](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/combat-enhancements/)
Adds a radial health bar, an editable HP field, and drag/drop re-ordering to the combat tracker.

### [Combat Utility Belt]()
Does a shit ton of stuff to reduce the amount of stuff the DM has to finagle for, like rolling for summons, tracking concentration, keeping track of conditions, etc etc. Basically just reduces how much a DM has to click around in submenus, it streamlines it. Also has some hefty computation stuff it can do.

### [Token Action HUD](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-action-hud/)
Offers a HUD of all the actions that a player can take during their turn, streamlining combat and making sure players don't have to live in their character sheet and can instead focus on what's happening. Might actually replace this with the [Argon Combat HUD](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/enhancedcombathud), I'm experimenting right now.

### [Group Initative](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/group-initiative/)
Lets you roll initiative for enemies as a group instead of forcing you to roll them individually, if that's something you're into.

### [Ready Up](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/koboldworks-ready-up)
Lets players know when their turn is up next so they're ready for it. 

### [Convienient Effects](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dfreds-convenient-effects)
Another mod that automates a lot of conditions and effects and makes it easier on the DM.

### [Show Drag Distance](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ShowDragDistance)
Shows how far you're dragging a token / whether or not it's movement or a dash.

### [Combat Tracker Effect Icon Tooltip]()
