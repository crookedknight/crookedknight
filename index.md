### [Turn Marker](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/turnmarker/)
Marks whose turn it is by outlining the token in a custom border that you can choose. 

### [Combat Enhancements](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/combat-enhancements/)
Adds a radial health bar, an editable HP field, and drag/drop re-ordering to the combat tracker.

### [Combat Utility Belt]()
Does a shit ton of stuff to reduce the amount of stuff the DM has to finagle for, like rolling for summons, tracking concentration, keeping track of conditions, etc etc. Basically just reduces how much a DM has to click around in submenus, it streamlines it. Also has some hefty computation stuff it can do.

### [Token Action HUD](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-action-hud/)
Offers a HUD of all the actions that a player can take during their turn, streamlining combat and making sure players don't have to live in their character sheet and can instead focus on what's happening.

### [Group Initative](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/group-initiative/)
Lets you roll initiative for enemies as a group instead of forcing you to roll them individually, if that's something you're into.

### [Combat Ready](https://github.com/smilligan93/combatready)
Adds a little notification to each player when their turn is next so they can be ready. 




## GAMEPLAY MODULES

### [Forien's Quest Log]()
I really love this one, it lets you add a quest-log in-game with custom quests.

### [Dice Tray](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-calculator)
Adds a little dice tray at the bottom of the sidebar that players can use instead of /roll markdown. 

### [Dice So Nice](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-so-nice)
Adds 3D dice that roll on the screen, and lets players configure and personalize their dice. Also lets you add effects to D20s or nat 1s.

### [Let Me Roll That For You](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/fvtt-module-lmrtfy)
Lets you prompt players to give you a roll. 

### [Polyglot](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/fvtt-module-polyglot)
A fun little flavor thing. Lets you disguise text with a fantasy script in a little speech bubble for when tokens or characters are talking in a language players don't understand.

### [Token Mold](https://github.com/Moerill/token-mold)
Can do all kinds of things to help speed up adding tokens, and can also let you add things to tokens so you don't have to click into their character sheets, which you can restrict to only be visible to the token owner. Also a bajillion other things.

### [Actually Private Rolls](https://github.com/syl3r86/Actually-Private-Rolls)
Lets the DM make rolls that are actually, genuinely hidden from the players, instead of showing the little "GM has rolled privately!" box that sucks ass. 

### [Cursor Hider](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cursor-hider)
Lets you, as the DM, hide your ruler and cursor from players.


## VISUAL MODULES

### [Parallaxia](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/parallaxia/)
Allows for cool animations if you tinker with it, like shadows flying over a map, clouds, dynamic leveling, etc.
